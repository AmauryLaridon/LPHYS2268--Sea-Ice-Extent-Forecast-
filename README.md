![data_pp_APF CAPF](https://github.com/AmauryLaridon/LPHYS2268-Sea-Ice-Extent-Forecast/assets/58213378/13689844-3dec-4a13-a7a0-a0a299de1d4a)

### Why this repository ? 
GitHub made for the Project : **"Seasonal prediction of summer Arctic Sea Ice Extent"** of the *LPHYS2268 - Forecast prediction and projection in Climate Science* class.

This project has been done by Élise Françoisse, Augustin Lambotte, Amaury Laridon, Juliette Tamburro et Celestin Tchakounté.

**The goal of this project is to perform a seasonal prediction of summer Arctic Sea Ice Extent (SIE) using various forecasting techniques. The main production of this project is to realise an infography** in order to communicate our results towards student who has the same level as ours but who has not followed the course.  

**The final infography of the project is a set of Instragram posts available at :** [Instagram Post](https://www.instagram.com/douglace7?igshid=YzVkODRmOTdmMw==)

### Organisation of the files 

For more informations about the procedure of this project have a look at the *Project_LPHYS2268.pdf* file. 

The observed data used of the Sea Ice Extent (SIE) is in the *Data* folder. The *v1* corresponds to the monthly SIE data from 1979 to 2022 with the last data available beeing the SIE for May 2022. The *v2* data set corresponds to the monthly SIE from 1979 to 2023 with the last data available beeing the SIE for May 2023. 

All the figures from used in the instagram posts as well as many others are in the *Figures* folder.The folders are divided for the two different dataset. The */Figures22* folder beeing related to the *v1* dataset while the */Figures23* folder is related to the *v2* dataset. 

The analysis of the data, the differents forecast techniques and all the functions making the figures are done with the *sea_ice_extent.py* python script. 

### How To run ? 

Simply download localy this repository and execute the *sea_ice_extent.py* script. The path for saving the figures written at the top of the script have to be modified for your local repository.
